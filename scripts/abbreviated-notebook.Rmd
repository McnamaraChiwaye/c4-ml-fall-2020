This module is designed to get you thinking about how to strategically approach
training a deep learning (DL) model. Although finding optimal hyperparameters
for a DL model includes a lot of artistry and patience, using a methodical
approach can reduce overall model exploratory time. 

The following steps provide a good mental model for tuning our model. Realize
this approach does not guarantee you'll find the optimal model; however, it
should give you a higher probability of finding a near optimal one.

1. Prepare data
2. Balance batch size with a default learning rate
3. Tune the adaptive learning rate optimizer
4. Add callbacks to control training
5. Explore model capacity
6. Regularize overfitting
7. Repeat steps 1-6
8. Evaluate final model results

We'll demonstrate with one of the most famous benchmark data sets, MNIST. We'll
continue working with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP); however, realize that
these steps also translate to other DL models (i.e. CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs).

# Package Requirements

```{r}
library(keras)       # for modeling
library(tidyverse)   # for wrangling & visualization
library(glue)        # for string literals
```

# MNIST

`keras` has many built in data sets (or functions to automatically install data
sets). Check out the available datasets with `dataset_` + tab.

We're going to use the __MNIST__ data set which is the "hello world" for 
learning deep learning! [ℹ️](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

```{r data}
mnist <- dataset_mnist()
str(mnist)
```

Our training images (aka features) are stored as 3D arrays

* 60,000 images consisting of a...
* 28x28 matrix with...
* values ranging from 0-255 representing gray scale pixel values.

```{r features}
# 60K images of 28x28 pixels
dim(mnist$train$x)

# pixel values are gray scale ranging from 0-255
range(mnist$train$x)
```

Check out the first digit

```{r first-digit}
digit <- mnist$train$x[1,,]
digit
```

Lets plot the first digit and compare to the above matrix

```{r plot-first-digit}
plot(as.raster(digit, max = 255))
```

Now lets check out the first 100 digits

```{r plot-first-100-digits}
par(mfrow = c(10, 10), mar = c(0,0,0,0))
for (i in 1:100) {
  plot(as.raster(mnist$train$x[i,,], max = 255))
}
```

# Prepare Data

When we work with keras:

* training and test sets need to be independent
* features and labels (aka target, response) need to be independent
* use `%<-%` for ___object unpacking___ (see `?zeallot::%<-%`)

```{r extract-train-test}
c(c(train_images, train_labels), 
  c(test_images, test_labels)) %<-% mnist

# the above is the same as
# train_images <- mnist$train$x
# train_labels <- mnist$train$y
# test_images <- mnist$test$x
# test_labels <- mnist$test$y
```

## Shape into proper tensor form

The shape of our data is dependent on the type of DL model we are training. MLPs
require our data to be in a 2D tensor (aka matrix); however, our data are
currently in a 3D tensor.

We can reshape our tensor from 3D to 2D. Much like a matrix can be flattened to
a vector:

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)
m

# flattened matrix
as.vector(m)
```

We can reshape a 3D array to a 2D array with `array_reshape()`

![](images/reshape.png)

```{r reshape-to-2D-tensor}
# reshape 3D tensor (aka array) to a 2D tensor (aka matrix)
train_images <- array_reshape(train_images, c(60000, 28 * 28))
test_images <- array_reshape(test_images, c(10000, 28 * 28))

# our training data is now a matrix with 60K observations and
# 784 features (28 pixels x 28 pixels = 784)
str(train_images)
```

Since we are dealing with a multi-classification problem where the target ranges
from 0-9, we'll reformat with `to_categorical()`. 

__Note__: column 1 refers to the digit "0", column 2 refers to the digit "1", etc.

```{r}
train_labels <- to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels <- to_categorical(test_labels)

head(train_labels)
```

## Stabilize learning by data scaling

When applying DL models, our feature values should not be relatively large
compared to the randomized initial weights _and_ all our features should take
values in roughly the same range. 

> ___When features have large or widely varying values, large gradient updates can
be triggered that will prevent the network from converging___

__Tips__:

1. When all features have the same value range (i.e. images), we can standardize
   values between 0-1.

2. When features varying in range from one another (i.e. age, height, longitude)
   normalize each feature to have mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 (?`scale()`)

```{r}
# all our features (pixels) range from 0-255
range(train_images)
```

```{r}
# standardize train and test features
train_images <- train_images / 255
test_images <- test_images / 255
```

## Randomize data

Although I know that this data is not ordered, we should always get in the habit
of randomizing our data so that our train and validation datasets are properly
represented.

```{r}
obs <- nrow(train_images)
set.seed(123)
randomize <- sample(seq_len(obs), size = obs, replace = FALSE)
train_images <- train_images[randomize, ]
train_labels <- train_labels[randomize, ]
```

We're finally ready to train some DL models!!

## Daniel Edits
All of the above is from Brad, and I really recommend you checkout the full
notebook. It's a great place to get started. But because I know we'll be short
on time, I wanted to jump ahead a bit. 

In the chunk below, fit a multi-layer perceptron network to try to predict
which digit is represented by each image (i.e., each row of the data matrix).

The model should have the following characteristics:
* A single hidden layer with 512 perceptrons
* A ReLU activation function for the hidden layer and a *softmax* activation 
  function for the output layer
* Make sure you specify your output layer to have 10 perceptrons (one for each
  digit you are predicting)
* Start by optimizing with stochastic gradient descent with the default batch 
  size (32). Vary the batch size and add momentum to your learning rate to see
  if you can improve fit.
* Use callbacks to reduce the learning rate on a plateau
* Once you have completed the above, if there is still time, try varying your
  model capacity to see if you can improve fit

**Hint** Careful about not overwriting objects. When you compile, for example,
you are actually updating the model object even if you're not re-assigning it.
This means you can't re-run a model by just re-running the fit. You 
have to first re-define the model, then re-compile it, then re-fit it.

```{r model}
model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = ___, 
              activation = ___, 
              input_shape = ___) %>%
  layer_dense(units = ___, 
              activation = ___)

model %>% compile(
  loss = "categorical_crossentropy",
  optimizer = ___,
  metrics = "accuracy"
)

history <- model %>% fit(
  ___, ___,
  validation_split = 0.2,
  batch_size = ___,
  epochs = ___,
  callback = list(
    ___,
    ___
    )
  )
```
