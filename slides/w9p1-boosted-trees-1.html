# Gradient Boosting (with trees)
### Daniel Anderson
### Week 9, Class 1

---




# Agenda
* Boosting

* Gradient descent

* Standard boosted tree hyperparameters

* Additional hyperparameters with **{xgboost}**

* Initial implementation with {tidymodels}
  
  + This will mostly be for Wednesday

---
# Quick scheduling note
* Next Monday, we have a scheduled work day. This is intended for you to work with your group on your final project, while having Joe and I present to help you work though any problems

  + If you are having specific issues, that would be a great time for us to help you solve them
  
  + Otherwise, it's a designated time for you all to work together
  

--
* Next Wednesday, we will cover [Keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/index.html) in [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)

* Keras is a high-level API for neural nets - can use numerous back-ends for estimation, including [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)


---
# Before Wednesday!

Please run the following:


```r
install.packages("keras")
keras::install_keras()
```

We'll run through some basic models and hopefully have you fitting some basic neural nets by the end

Please do this ASAP, and if you run into issues, please contact me

---
# Quick review

* For bagged trees and random forests, we create `\(b\)` bootstrap resamples of the training data. We then fit a model to each resample and aggregate the results for a single prediction


--
* Random forests include an additional stochastic component, sampling `\(m\)` features for each split in each tree for every resample, which can help decorrelate the trees and lead to better predictions


--
* For each of these models, you need a *sufficient* number of resamples to obtain a stable estimate, but additional resamples will only "cost" in terms of computational efficiency 


---
# Boosting

* Like bagging, boosting is a general algorithm that can be applied to any model, but it's very common with trees


--
* Like bagging, boosting is an ensemble approach, where many models are fit to the data


--
### Key difference from bagging
* Rather than using boostrapping, boosted models are built .b[.ital[sequentially]], with each model fit to the residuals from the previous


--
* information from tree 1 .b[feeds into] tree 2, which .b[feeds into] tree 3... etc.

---
# Components of boosting

* .bolder[.b[Base learner]]: The model that is iteratively fit. Can be any model but is regularly a .ital[shallow] decision tree


--
* .bolder[.b[Weak models]]: Improves error rate only slightly more than chance. The weak learning is boosted by the iterative fit, and the model learns slow 

    + Trees with 1-6 splits are common


  
--
* .bolder[.b[Sequential fit]]: See algorithm on next slide

---
# Sequential fitting algorithm

1. Fit a decision tree to the data: `\(f_1\left(x\right) = y\)`


--
2. Fit a second decision tree to the residuals of the first: `\(h_1\left(x\right) = y - f_1\left(x\right)\)`


--
3. Add the trees together to obtain an ensemble algorithm: `\(f_2\left(x\right) = f_1\left(x\right) + h_1\left(x\right)\)`


--
4. Fit a new decision tree to the residuals of this model: `\(h_2\left(x\right) = y - f_2\left(x\right)\)`


--
5. Add this tree to our ensemble: `\(f_3\left(x\right) = f_2\left(x\right) + h_2\left(x\right)\)`


--
6. Continue onward until some criterion (stopping rule) is met

---
# Final Model

$$
f\left(x\right) =  \sum^B_{b=1}f^b\left(x\right)
$$

---
# Slow learning

* Boosted models typically .ital[learn slow], which may sound bad, but is actually helpful in finding an optimal solution


--
* Each tree is very shallow, and learns little about the data on its own


--
* By contrast, random forests include aggregation across many deep, independent trees (i.e., each tree learns a lot, but variance is reduced through averaging)

### Slow Learning Illustrated

.footnote[https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/gbm.html]


---
# Note, this doesn't mean it's always optimal

* In a simple linear regression case, where we *know* how the data were generated, linear regression still wins!

* This can be the case even if we *don't know* how the underlying data were generated, but the problem is relatively simple.


---
# Quick example


```r
set.seed(3)

# parameters
alpha &lt;- 10
b1 &lt;- 5
x &lt;- 1:100
log_x &lt;- log(x)
e &lt;- rnorm(length(x), sd = 0.8)

#outcome
y &lt;- alpha + b1*log_x + e

sim &lt;- data.frame(x, y)
```


---
# Plot


```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(sim, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](w9p1-boosted-trees-1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Modeling
* In this case, the "best" model is one that models exactly the function that created the data - log transforming `x`

* We can get *close* to this with a spline

* Although a boosted tree model is often among the best "out of the box" models, it will not do as well as either of the previous models, in this (very simple case)

---
# Illustration

### Create recipes for log transformation and a B-spline

Quick side-note: Any idea why I'm using a B-spline instead of a natural spline?


```r
library(tidymodels)
rec_log &lt;- recipe(y ~ x, sim) %&gt;% 
  step_log(x)

rec_spline &lt;- recipe(y ~ x, sim) %&gt;% 
  step_bs(x, deg_free = tune())
```

---
# Candidate models

* I'm omitting the code for for boosted trees because I'll be fitting it outside of the **{tidymodels}** framework, but we'll get there soon (wiht **{tidymodels}**).


```r

Note that the boosted tree model has both lower average performance *and* higher variance.

Does that mean it's a crappy model and we shouldn't be learning it? **No!** It just means that in this one, very simple case, it doesn't perform as well as simpler models

# Out of the box performance
* Despite what we just saw, boosted tree models are typically one of the "best" out-of-the-box model for performance on tabular data

* One of the most frequent algorithms used across Kaggle winners (although there's a few new variants that have been gaining popularity)

* A boosted model "when appropriately tuned, is often hard to beat with other algorithms" ([Bohemke &amp; Greenwell](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/gbm.html))

* Doesn't mean it's **always** better than simpler models, but if you have complex data, it's likely to perform well.

# Gradient Descent

* General purpose optimization algorithm

--
* Gradient descent and its variants (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) are used throughout many advanced ML applications (e.g., deep learning)


--
* Evaluate prediction against a cost function (objective function to minimize) and move in direction of steepest descent until you reach a minimum

--
* Gradient descent is used with boosted trees to inform how each subsequent tree should be built

# Estimate with gradient descent
* First, define the cost function (mean square error)

$$
\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (a + bx_i ))^2
$$

--
* Next, calculate the partial derivative of each parameter .g[this is not my strong suit]


--
$$
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{d}{da}\\\\
     \frac{d}{db}\\\\
    \end{bmatrix}
=
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{1}{N} \sum -2(y_i - (a + bx_i)) \\\\
     \frac{1}{N} \sum -2x_i(y_i - (a + bx_i)) \\\\
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

---
# Gradient descent
* The partial derivatives of the cost function define gradient


--
* We move in the steepest direction


--
* The amount we move is defined by our learning rate, which is multiplied by the partial derivative values


--
* The resulting value is then subtracted (because we're minimizing) from our *current* parameter estimate


--
* Iterate until no improvements are made

---
# Gradient descent "by hand"

Let's start by writing a function to calculate the mean squared error (our cost function)


```r
mse &lt;- function(a, b, x = sim_d$x, y = sim_d$y) {
  prediction &lt;- a + b*x # model prediction, given intercept/slope
  residuals &lt;- y - prediction # distance between prediction &amp; observed
  squared_residuals &lt;- residuals^2 # squared to avoid summation to zero
  ssr &lt;- sum(squared_residuals) # sum of squared distances
  
  mean(ssr) # average of squared distances
}
```

---
# Double check 
Does our function work? Let's use the OLS coefficients to compute the MSE, then compare this to what we get from the actual model residuals.


```r
mse(a = coef(sim_ols)[1], b = coef(sim_ols)[2])
```

```
## [1] 16809.93
```

```r
sum(resid(sim_ols)^2)
```

```
## [1] 16809.93
```

### Hooray!

---
# Explore other candidate lines
We're trying to minimize the MSE. Let's just try a few other lines


```r
mse(0.5, 3)
```

```
## [1] 40915.99
```

```r
mse(1, 2)
```

```
## [1] 34044.36
```

```r
mse(1, 3)
```

```
## [1] 36531.42
```

```r
mse(1, 1.5)
```

```
## [1] 33584.1
```

---
# Plot these lines


```r
ggplot(sim_d, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0.5, slope = 3) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 1, slope = 2) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 1, slope = 3) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0.5, slope = 1.5)
```

# View Cost Surface


```r
library(colorspace)

grid &lt;- grid %&gt;% 
  mutate(cost = map2_dbl(a, b, mse))

    geom_raster(aes(fill = cost)) +

```

# 3D version

```r
library(rayshader)

plot_gg(surface, multicore = TRUE)
render_movie(filename = here::here("slides", "img", "cost-surface.mp4"), 
             title_text = 'Cost surface', 
             phi = 30 , theta = -45)
```

---
# Find the minimum value

In this case, we've just calculated the cost function for a big range of values. Pretty easy to find the minimum.


```r
grid %&gt;% 
  arrange(cost) %&gt;% 
  slice(1)
```

```
##     a   b     cost
## 1 5.1 1.4 16810.19
```

But this is only possible because the problem is so simple. It's not an *efficient* approach, and would quickly become infeasible.

---
# Gradient descent
* Start at a random location, go downhill until you can't anymore

* The gradient is determined by the partial derivative of the model parameters

--
Reminder: these are the partial derivatives for the MSE with an intercept and one slope

$$
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{d}{da}\\\\
     \frac{d}{db}\\\\
    \end{bmatrix}
=
   \begin{bmatrix}
     \frac{1}{N} \sum -2(y_i - (a + bx_i)) \\\\
     \frac{1}{N} \sum -2x_i(y_i - (a + bx_i)) \\\\
    \end{bmatrix}
$$
---
# Compute the gradient
Let's write a function that computes the gradient for any point on the cost surface


```r
compute_gradient &lt;- function(a, b, x = sim_d$x, y = sim_d$y) {
  n &lt;- length(y)
  predictions &lt;- a + (b * x)
  residuals &lt;- y - predictions
  
  da &lt;- (1/n) * sum(-2*residuals)
  db &lt;- (1/n) * sum(-2*x*residuals)
  
  c(da, db)
}
```

---
# Take a step downhill
We'll use the gradient to take a step in the steepest direction. The size of the step is determined by the learning rate.


```r
gd_step &lt;- function(a, b, 
                    learning_rate = 0.1, 
                    x = sim_d$x, 
                    y = sim_d$y) {
  grad &lt;- compute_gradient(a, b, x, y)
  step_a &lt;- grad[1] * learning_rate
  step_b &lt;- grad[2] * learning_rate
  
  c(a - step_a, b - step_b)
}
```

# Quick look at polynomial regression


---
# Why do this?
* For algorithms like linear regression, we wouldn't. We have a closed-form solution to minimize the sum of the squared errors.


--
* For many algorithms, there is no closed-form solution. So - define a cost function, and go "downhill" until you reach a minimum


--
* Downside? Slower than a closed-form solution (have to estimate iteratively)

--
* Upside? We can minimize a cost function in a much more general way.

---
# Why spend so much time on this?

This is how boosted trees work
* Start by fitting a shallow tree
* Subsequent tree splits are determined by the values are steepest in the gradient of the cost function
* "Step" that direction by multiplying by the learning rate

The learning rate is also called *shrinkage*, because it is reducing (shrinking) the speed at which the algorithm moves downhill (a value of 1.0 would be no shrinkage, but values greater that 0.3 are rare)

# Back to Boosted Trees

# Hyperparameters
Standard boosted trees include the following four hyperparameters

* Tree depth

* Minimum `\(n\)` for a terminal node

* `\(n\)` trees

* Learning rate


---
# Tree depth
* Just like standard decision trees, the tree depth is an important hyperparameter
  

--
* However, with boosted trees we typically grow very shallow trees - an ensemble of "stumps" is common, and typical trees range from 3-6 splits


--
* Stumps are computationally efficient (but require more trees)

* Deeper trees (more splits) may capture important interactions, but have a higher risk of overfitting


--
.b[Tree depth (number of splits) is a highly important hyperparameter]


---
# `\(n\)` trees

* Unlike boosted trees and random forests, the number of trees .b[is] a hyperparameter


--
* The number of trees fit to the data will determine how much is learned 


--
### Probably obvious but...

* Too few trees, and the model will underfit

* Too many trees, and the model will overfit


--
This is a really important hyperparameter for standard decision trees

Its optimization will depend on the tree depth

.g[Shallower trees will learn less, and will be optimized at a higher number of total trees]

# Learning rate

# Learning rate
Also called .ital[shrinkage]
* Values range from 0-1, but typically range from 0.001 to 0.3 

--
### Smaller values:
* Mean less is learned from each tree, making it more robust to specific characteristics of any individual tree, and good generalizations
* Make it easier to stop early &amp; avoid overfitting
* Greater potential for "optimal" accuracy


--
### .b[But]

* Also prone to local minima
* Lead to a more computationally intensive model &amp; will require more trees

---
# Minimum `\(n\)` per terminal node

* Technically a hyperparameter, but rarely comes into play

* Trees are not grown sufficiently deep for it to matter (usually)

---
# Standard boosted tree tuning strategy

1. Start out with a relatively high learning rate (I generally start at `\(0.1\)`) 

2. Determine optimal `\(n\)` trees (for this learning rate)

3. Fix tree `\(n\)` and tune learning rate

4. Tune tree-specific parameters for chosen learning rate

5. Fix tree-specific parameters, lower learning rate to see if you can make any further gains

# Extensions

--
Everything we've discussed so far would be considered a .b[standard] gradient boosted tree


--
The most common package for .b[standard] gradient boosted trees is [{gbm}](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm), which is not implemented in {tidymodels}. 


--
So... let's proceed with further complications!


---
# Stochastic GBM

* Similar to bagged trees and random forests, introducing randomness to the sample and/or the features can sometimes help predictive accuracy
  

--
* Sampling of cases is conducted for each tree

    + Subsample between 50%-80% of the training data for each tree 

.footnote[Note - other subsample values will regularly work better, but somewhere in this range should be your starting point]


--
* Sampling of features can be conducted by tree .b[or] by split (or actually by depth level)


---
# Model tuning
Bokhmke &amp; Greenwell note:

&gt; we have not seen strong interactions between the stochastic hyperparameters and the other boosting and tree-specific hyperparameters


--
Recommend evaluating random sampling proportions either with tree-specific hyperparameters, or after finalizing all the previous steps

---
# Hyperparameters
We are now at .b[7] hyperparameters (and we're not done yet):


* Tree depth

* `\(n\)` trees

* Learning rate

* Minimum `\(n\)` for a terminal node

* Subsample of rows

* Subsample of columns for each .ital[tree]

* Subsample of columns for each .ital[split] .g[Not implemented in tidymodels but easy to add]

---
# XGBoost

e.b[X]treme .b[G]radient .b[Boost]ing


--
* Primary algorithm implemented in .ital[tidymodels] (that we're concerned with)


--
* Optimized distributed boosting (i.e., fast)


--
* Includes .b[even more] hyperparameter options, but we'll only mention a few of these


---
# Gamma (aka `loss_reduction`)

* Controls tree depth

* Specifies a minimum loss required for further splits

* Scale dependent, and ranges from `\(0 - \infty\)`


--
* Boehmke &amp; Greenwell note that values between 1-20 are common


--
* L1 and L2 penalties are also available in {xgboost}, but have to be passed directly to the model function. The arguments are `alpha` and `gamma`, respectively.


---
# Early stopping

* New/different way of controlling both the speed of your alogorithm .ital[and] the complexity of your model


--
* Because the number of trees is a hyperparamter, it helps guard against overfiting


--
### How?

* Specify a number, `\(n\)`, to tell the algorithm to stop after the algorithm is not improving


---
# Tuning an XGBoost model
* These additional regularizers change the way we approach tuning our model


--
* Instead of first assessing how many trees are needed, we'll specify a large number of treees to be built, but specify an early stopping rule


--
* Tune the learning rate, then tree-specific parameters, then stochastic components


--
* Retune learning rate if your find values that are really different than defaults


--
* If CV error suggests substantial overfitting, crank up regluarization


---
class: inverse center normal
# Implementation with **{tidymodels}**
I'm assuming we're mostly out of time

---
# {parsnip}
* When we set a model, we just use `boost_tree()` for our model, and `set_engine("xgboost")` 

* Essentially everything else is the same

--

```r
boosted_tree_spec &lt;- boost_tree() %&gt;% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %&gt;% 
  set_mode("regression") %&gt;% # or classification, of course
  set_args(...)
```

---
# Quick note on performance
By default, **{xgboost}** will use all the processors on your computer

You can override this with the `nthread` argument when you `set_engine()`, e.g., `set_engine("xgboost", nthread = 2)`

The `xgboost` package is *highly* performant compared to other similar algorithms, and it works great on the cluster

---
# Hyperparameters

We'll actually start fitting models on Wednesday
